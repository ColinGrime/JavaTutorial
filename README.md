# Java Tutorial

There's a lot of tutorials out there, so here's another one.  
Originally made as a supplement to this YouTube video: xxx

Splits Java up into different **Levels** (sounds more fun), see [Levels](#Levels) below.  
Each **Level** also has multiple exercises associated with them, see [Exercises](#Exercises) below.

## Usage

Here's my recommended usage of this resource:
1. Find another Java tutorial (or use the video posted above).
2. Use this resource as a reference page / notes.
3. Code! Code! Code!
4. If you forget something while coding, use this as a refresher.

Working on projects will be the best way to learn all the material.
If you're like me (and can't ever think of projects to work on), I listed
numerous [exercises](#Exercises) to supplement this supplement.

Be consistent - good luck!
